        <p class="css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0">Just like their human counterparts, every single dog in the world is perfect and
            adorable in its own way. Picking the cutest among them is like picking the cutest baby in the nursery. That
            is to
            say, the one that belongs to <em>you </em>and your family is undoubtedly the most breathtaking, irresistible
            creature in the lot! </p>
        <p class="css-18vfmjb et3p2gv0">Still, we’ll take any opportunity to scroll through pictures of precious pups in
            a
            futile but fun effort to identify the<strong> cutest dog breeds</strong> on the planet. Those paws and pads!
            Those
            fuzzy bellies and tails! Those wet noses and floppy ears and happy tongues… we could just eat them all up.
            Every
            last one of these doggos is the goodest boy or girl — hands down. Which one is the cutest isn't a matter of
            fact,
            but rather a matter of personal opinion. And absolutely all dogs deserve a lifetime of play, treats, love,
            and
            loyalty as essential members of the family.</p>
